👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Kirtidhwaj Patra.

I’m an iOS Engineer with 2.5+ years of experience building high-performance, production-grade iOS applications. I specialize in Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit, with a strong focus on modular architecture, concurrency, and system reliability.

I enjoy working on problems where state, data flow, and user experience intersect, and I care deeply about writing code that scales well over time.

🧠 Engineering Focus

Native iOS development using Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit

Modular application architecture and separation of concerns

Asynchronous data handling using Swift Concurrency

Reliable client-side systems under real-world network conditions

Product-driven engineering with attention to usability and clarity

💼 Experience
iOS Developer & Designer — PRM Global Tech

Jun 2024 – Mar 2025

Owned development of core iOS features using SwiftUI within a modular codebase designed for long-term maintainability.

Defined clear separation between UI, state, and business logic, improving testability and scalability.

Implemented asynchronous data handling using Swift Concurrency, ensuring predictable state updates and stable behavior under varying network conditions.

Mobile Engineer (iOS) — The Vue Branding

Apr 2023 – May 2024

Worked on a shared, long-lived iOS codebase, making architectural decisions focused on clarity, correctness, and maintainability.

Designed navigation and state-handling patterns to support complex, multi-step user flows.

Integrated backend APIs with defensive error handling and graceful degradation under unreliable network conditions.

Creative Partner — Pop Club

Oct 2023 – Mar 2024

Led UX strategy and experimentation, contributing to measurable improvements in user engagement and retention.

Collaborated closely with engineers to translate interaction concepts into production-ready mobile experiences.

📱 Selected Projects
