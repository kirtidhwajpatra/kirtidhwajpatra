# About Me

Hi, I'm Kirtidhwaj Patra! 👋

I am an **iOS Software Engineer** with 2+ years of experience specializing in **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **UIKit**. I focus on building high-performance, human-centered products by combining strong engineering practices (Concurrency, C++, MVVM) with precise UI/UX execution.

### 🌟 Professional Impact

* **Real-time Communication:** Engineered a low-latency P2P audio calling platform using **WebRTC** and Node.js signaling, enabling smooth English practice sessions.
* **Game Engine Design:** Developed a deterministic game engine for a native **Ludo** iOS game, optimizing complex state management and animations in SwiftUI.
* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** implemented an unbeatable single-player mode for TicTacToe using the **Minimax Algorithm**, alongside fault-tolerant real-time multiplayer synchronization.
* **Performance Optimization:** Reduced scroll hitching and memory footprint in list-heavy views by utilizing **Instruments** for profiling and optimizing view recycling.
* **System Integration:** Integrated high-performance C++ modules into iOS workflows using Objective-C++ wrappers for critical computation tasks.

### 💼 Work Experience

**iOS Developer & Designer | PRM Global Tech** *(June 2024 - Mar 2025)*
* **C++ Integration:** Bridged C++ algorithms via Objective-C++, boosting runtime efficiency by **25%** and ensuring 60fps scrolling.
* **Scalable Modules:** Shipped critical SwiftUI/MVVM-C features, driving a **15% increase** in user engagement.
* **Concurrency:** Eliminated race conditions in complex data streams using **Swift Concurrency (Async/Await)**.

**Mobile Experience Engineer | The VUE Branding** *(April 2023 - May 2024)*
* **Flow Optimization:** Reduced user drop-off by **20%** during onboarding through optimized navigation patterns.
* **Performance:** Refined render loops and memory usage to ensure "butter-smooth" interactions across devices.

**Creative Partner | POP Club** *(Oct 2022 - March 2024)*
* **Mobile-First:** Championed strict adherence to iOS Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).
* **Prototyping:** Validated complex motion concepts using GSAP before engineering handoff.

### 📱 Selected Projects
