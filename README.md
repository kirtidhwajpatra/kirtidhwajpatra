# About Me

Hi, I'm Kirtidhwaj Patra! 👋

I am a systems-oriented **iOS Engineer** with a strong focus on building high-performance native applications. I specialize in leveraging **Swift** and **SwiftUI** to deliver robust architectures that prioritize correctness and scalability. My work often bridges the gap between high-level UI and low-level systems like **WebRTC** and **C++** integration to create seamless user experiences.

### 🌟 Professional Impact

* **Real-time Communication:** Engineered a low-latency P2P audio calling platform using **WebRTC** and Node.js signaling, enabling smooth English practice sessions.
* **Game Engine Design:** Developed a deterministic game engine for a native **Ludo** iOS game, optimizing complex state management and animations in SwiftUI.
* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** implemented an unbeatable single-player mode for TicTacToe using the **Minimax Algorithm**, alongside fault-tolerant real-time multiplayer synchronization.
* **Performance Optimization:** Reduced scroll hitching and memory footprint in list-heavy views by utilizing **Instruments** for profiling and optimizing view recycling.
* **System Integration:** Integrated high-performance C++ modules into iOS workflows using Objective-C++ wrappers for critical computation tasks.

### 🎓 Education
