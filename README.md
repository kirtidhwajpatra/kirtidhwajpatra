About Me 👋

Hi, I'm Kirtidhwaj Patra!

I am an iOS Engineer with 2.5+ years of experience building native, production-grade iOS applications using Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit. I focus on writing clean, modular code and designing reliable client-side systems that scale well over time.

I enjoy working at the intersection of architecture, state management, and user experience, and I care deeply about correctness, maintainability, and long-term product quality.

🌟 Professional Impact

Real-time Systems: Built iOS features supporting real-time interactions, focusing on predictable state updates and reliable behavior under varying network conditions.

Deterministic State Management: Designed deterministic client-side logic for multiplayer and interactive experiences, ensuring consistent behavior across sessions.

Algorithmic Problem Solving: Solved 450+ algorithmic problems across LeetCode, Codeforces, and GeeksforGeeks, strengthening correctness and efficiency in production code.

Performance & Reliability: Improved responsiveness and stability in complex SwiftUI views through careful state handling and performance profiling.

Product-driven Engineering: Translated ambiguous product requirements into well-scoped iOS solutions aligned with user needs.
