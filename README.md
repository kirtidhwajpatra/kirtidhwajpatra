# About Me

Hi, I'm Kirtidhwaj Patra! 👋

I am an **iOS Software Engineer** with 2+ years of experience specializing in **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **UIKit**. I deliver high-performance, human-centered digital products by blending strong engineering practices (Concurrency, C++ Integration, MVVM) with an acute sense of UI/UX design. I am proficient in **Swift Concurrency**, architectural patterns, and creating scalable systems that are both fast and delightful to use.

### 🌟 Professional Impact
