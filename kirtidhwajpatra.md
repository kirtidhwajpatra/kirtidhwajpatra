# Kirtidhwaj Patra
iOS Engineer · SwiftUI · Systems-Oriented Mobile Development

I build production-quality native iOS applications with an emphasis on correctness, performance, and scalable architecture. I focus on clean state management, concurrency-safe designs, and integrating low-level systems when required.

## Snapshot
- Location: Remote / Open to opportunities (iOS / Mobile Engineering)  
- Primary focus: Swift, SwiftUI, systems-oriented mobile engineering, robust concurrency  
- Engineering priorities: correctness → performance → polish

---

## Experience Summary
- Production iOS development using Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit  
- Strong grounding in MVVM and modular architecture for maintainable codebases  
- Integration of C++ components into iOS via Objective-C++ for performance-critical workflows  
- Concurrency-safe design using Swift Concurrency and structured async patterns  
- UI implementations aligned with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and accessibility best practices

## Selected Projects

### EnglishJi
Real-time peer-to-peer audio calling app for English practice, built with WebRTC and a lightweight Node.js signaling service.  
Key emphases: real-time systems, audio pipelines, concurrency, MVVM.

### Ludo — iOS Game
Native SwiftUI implementation of the Ludo board game with deterministic game logic and polished interactions.  
Key emphases: state management, animation, modular architecture, deterministic game rules.

### TicTacToe — Multiplayer
Local and online multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe with an AI opponent and real-time state synchronization.  
Key emphases: algorithms, game theory, networking, fault-tolerant state handling.

## Technical Strengths

- Languages: Swift, C++  
- iOS & Frontend: SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine, Swift Concurrency  
- Architecture & Patterns: MVVM, modular systems, unidirectional state flow  
- Systems & Networking: WebRTC, low-latency networking, real-time signaling  
- Tools & Practices: performance profiling, unit & integration testing, CI, dependency management  
- Problem Solving: data structures & algorithms (C++), deterministic logic for game engines

---

## Engineering Approach
- Prioritize correctness: explicit, testable behaviour and clear invariants  
- Performance-aware: measure first, optimize hotspots, leverage native components where needed  
- Concurrency-safe by design: structured async, avoid shared mutable state, favor immutable models when possible  
- Modular & maintainable: small, well-defined modules with clear interfaces to enable scalability and parallel development  
- Iterative polish: ship a correct, reliable baseline then iterate on UX and performance

## What I’m Interested In
- Challenging iOS/mobile engineering roles that require systems thinking and strong concurrency fundamentals  
- Projects that combine low-latency networking, media pipelines (audio/video), and performant native UI
